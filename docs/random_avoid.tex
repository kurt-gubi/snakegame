\section{Random Avoid Bot}
\fasttrack{Choose a direction at random, but not one which will lead to immediate death.}

The last bot we wrote had a big problem, it ran into its own tail.
We don’t want our next bot to be that stupid, so we need to teach it how to not
do that!

But before we can do that, we need to know few more things about our bots.
You might have noticed that our functions have two parameters,
\texttt{board} and \texttt{position}.
We haven’t had to use them so far, but we will now, so we need to know what they
are.
But rather than me just telling you what they are,
why not have a look yourself?

\pythonfile{print\_bot.py}

You should see something like this (on a 4x3 board):
\begin{minted}{pytb}
(1, 2)
[['.', '.', '*', '.'], ['.', '.', '*', '.'], ['.', 'A', '.', '.']]
Exception in bot A (<'<'>function print_bot at 0x7f61165f2e60<'>'>):
------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "…/snakegame/engine.py", line 132, in update_snakes
    "Return value should be a string."
AssertionError: Return value should be a string.
------------------------------------------------------------
\end{minted}

Ignore all the Exception stuff, that’s just because we didn’t return one of
\pyinline|'L'|, \pyinline|'U'|, \pyinline|'D'| or \pyinline|'R'|.
The first line is our position: it’s a \pyinline|tuple| of the x and y
coordinates of our snake’s head.
The second line is the board: it’s a list of each row in the board,
and each row is a list of the cells in that row.

Notice that if we index the board first by the y coordinate and then by the x
coordinate, we can get the character in the board where our snake is:
\pyinline|board[y][x] == board[2][1] == 'A'|.
The head of our snake is always an uppercase character in the board,
and the rest of our body (the tail) are always lowercase characters.

This is all very well, but how do we stop our bot from eating its tail?
Well, the answer is that we need to look at each of the squares surrounding our
snake’s head, to see if we’ll die if we move into them or not.
